## Remote-Controlled Robot Firmware

### Requirements

- remote controlled using video feed
- streams camera video over Wifi
- programmed in C
- battery powered
- discrete MOSFET motor drivers
- all electronics contained on one PCB
- map keys to driving direction
- 3D printed chassis that securely holds PCB, motors, batteries, and camera

### Design

- ESP 32 microcontroller
- 4 motors (AWD)

### Timeline

- Phase 1
  - Breadboard circuitry
  - Chassis + wheels I have in garage
  - Any motors
  - Still ESP32 controlled
  - Write initial software
- Phase 2
  - PCB Design
  - Full component selection
  - Software fine-tune
